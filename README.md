# Android-ColorPicker

Simple but very optimized color picker, can fit any size.

## Supports API 1

So no restriction in which app you can use it.
(Note: The sample has min Api 11 because of the styles i am using)

# How to use

* Implement the interface OnColorChangedListener (Notifies when a color was choose)
* Add at least a ColorArea to your layout
* (Optional) If you have a HueBar, send it to your ColorArea
* Set initial color to your ColorArea
* And... your done!

You can have a look at the sample app for a more specific case
